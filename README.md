This contains the initial versions of the object detection algorithm meant to quantify objects in flood waters. 

Current version is being tested against sample images collected by the CB_01 gateway part of the [Sunny Day Flooding Project](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project). Scripts used to pull flooded imagery, 
isolate daylight imagery and flood event data (sunnyd_image_pulling.ipynb, flood_tracking.ipynb, photo_utils.py, and utils.py) were provided by Ryan McCune. These may have a different version in a different repository.
